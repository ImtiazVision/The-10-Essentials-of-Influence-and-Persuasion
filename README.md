# The-10-Essentials-of-Influence-and-Persuasion

**Reciprocity**: is the social law that requires individuals to return to others the same sort of behavior and conduct that they got.

### How Reciprocity Works

1. The duty we feel to others is just the outcome of our accepting their assistance first.

2. In the context of an obligation, we are more inclined to respond "yes."

> The key to using reciprocity effectively and ethically is to give first, and to offer thoughtfully and with personalization.

> Those who initially provide help—in unconditional and personalized ways—emerge as the most persuasive.

The most successful persuaders are not those who inquire, "Who can assist me?" Instead, they are the ones who inquire, "Who may I assist first?"

### Personalize to persuade 

The lesson is obvious for anybody in the business of effective and ethical influence and persuasion: **the power of personalization is critical in persuasion**.

### Seek uncommon commonalities

> The path to "yes" is paved with commonalities. In the early stages of a relationship, it is critical to emphasize common interests, beliefs, backgrounds, and preferences.

**Uncommon Commonalities does the followings:**
  
  - Assist in establishing quick relationships
  - Accelerate the development of relationships
  - Encourage individuals to like one another.
