# The-10-Essentials-of-Influence-and-Persuasion :

**Reciprocity**: is the social law that requires individuals to return to others the same sort of behavior and conduct that they got.

### How Reciprocity Works

1. The duty we feel to others is just the outcome of our accepting their assistance first.

2. In the context of an obligation, we are more inclined to respond "yes."

> The key to using reciprocity effectively and ethically is to give first, and to offer thoughtfully and with personalization.

> Those who initially provide help—in unconditional and personalized ways—emerge as the most persuasive.

The most successful persuaders are not those who inquire, "Who can assist me?" Instead, they are the ones who inquire, "Who may I assist first?"

### Personalize to persuade 

The lesson is obvious for anybody in the business of effective and ethical influence and persuasion: **the power of personalization is critical in persuasion**.

### Seek uncommon commonalities

> The path to "yes" is paved with commonalities. In the early stages of a relationship, it is critical to emphasize common interests, beliefs, backgrounds, and preferences.

**Uncommon Commonalities does the followings:**
  
  - Assist in establishing quick relationships
  - Accelerate the development of relationships
  - Encourage individuals to like one another.

### How to Build an Effective Introduction 

People are convinced by advice from people they view as experts. Allowing someone else to introduce us removes the "self" from self-promotion. As a result, having someone else introduce us is the ideal option.

### Social Proof

Making an efficient decision based on the choices, actions, and behaviors of others is a solid method of making an efficient decision.

The most effective social proof is that which is relevant to the individual we are attempting to persuade.

### Don't oversell with reasons

> The ideal number of reasons to present in order to persuade someone is three. This is referred to by researchers as the "three charms, four alarms" rule.

### Power comes from progress.

When we are faced with situations where we need to influence and persuade others, and we know that we will need to interact with a number of people before the deal is closed or an agreement is finalized, it makes sense to signal the progress we are making at the start of each new meeting or interaction to ensure that our influence plan stays on track.

### Humanize in order to convince

We change the way information is digested by humanizing our messaging. People are more open to our message when they have a personal connection with us. The path to persuasion is always a human one. So, if we want to be more influential, the advice is to seek for methods to be more human.

### The significance of endings

People's recollections of their experiences might be untrustworthy. This is due to the fact that very few of us can recall every detail of an experience.
